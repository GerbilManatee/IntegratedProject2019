# IntegratedProject2019
This is a university project, creating a high level model approximating an attacker's movements in a deceptive network.
It isn't currently intended to model in-depth behaviour, but hopefully it will offer a basic platform in which more complex behaviours could be modelled.
The intent is to use a Monte Carlo model - run thousands of sims using a model, and average out the results to assess the probability of different outcomes.
